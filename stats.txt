G3:
Average solution length: 10
Average compute time: 0.97s
100 Success and 0 Timeouts, rate = 1.00

G2:
Average solution length: 19
Average compute time: 9.59s
93 Success and 7 Timeouts, rate = 0.93
3 timeouts < 3min to solve ( 0.96 with 3min timeout )
3 timeouts < 5min to solve ( 0.99 with 5min timeout )
1 timeout 16m to solve ( 1.0 with 20min timeout )

G1:
Average solution length: 29
Average compute time: 32.54s
45 Success and 19 Timeouts, rate = 0.70
All 19 timeouts goes straight to phase2 without any phase 1 move so we asume a 100% success at this stage...
